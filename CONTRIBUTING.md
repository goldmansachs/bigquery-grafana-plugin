## How can I contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

When creating a new bug report, please make sure to:

- Search for existing issues first. If you find a previous report of your issue, please update the existing issue with additional information instead of creating a new one.
- If you still decide to open an issue, please review the template and guidelines and include as much details as possible.

### Suggesting Enhancements / Feature Requests

If you would like to suggest an enhancement or ask for a new feature:

- Please check [the forum](https://feedback.doit-intl.com/forums/933776-grafana-bigquery-plugin) for existing threads about what you want to suggest/ask. If there is, feel free to upvote it to signal interest or add your comments.
- If there is no open thread, you're welcome to start one to have a discussion about what you want to suggest. Try to provide as much details and context as possible and include information about *the problem you want to solve* rather only *your proposed solution*.

### Pull Requests

- **Code contributions are welcomed**. For big changes or significant features, it's usually better to reach out first and discuss what you want to implement and how (we recommend reading: [Pull Request First](https://medium.com/practical-blend/pull-request-first-f6bb667a9b6#.ozlqxvj36)). This to make sure that what you want to implement is aligned with our goals for the project and that no one else is already working on it.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
- Please add [documentation](#documentation) for new features or changes in functionality along with the code.
